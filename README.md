This is a project repository for the DH-412 Semeter project that analyses the Hollywood and US Department of Defence Collaboration
## Project Description

The United States (US) is the military powerhouse of the world and at the same time, Hollywood is one of the oldest and largest film industries in the world. Therefore, examining the relationship between Hollywood and the Department of Defense (DoD) in the United States of America would explain what they are producing together. There have been large events in the past that have shown the effect of movies on the population. For example, after the movie Top Gun, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and in collaboration with the Pentagon was released, the army set up recruitment counters outside the movie theaters to handle the numerous enlisting requests Keeping these aspects in mind, this research would help us understand the attitude of the DoD or the image that the DoD is willing to create in the public's mind in accepting/refusing to provide help to the movie makers.
