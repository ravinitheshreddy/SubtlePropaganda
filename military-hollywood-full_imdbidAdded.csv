WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT,tt3553442,,APP,FILM,2016,"The production company filmed for several days at Kirtland AFB, because of  positive, if short AF portrayal, which was edited out of the final version. The script portrayed a U.S. Army transport brake failure, resulting in it hitting a group of Afghani shoppers in Kabul, killing and injuring them. This was changed to an NGO vehicle. Considerable Marine Corps portrayal, though the Marine Corps only provided on—set uniform and other technical advice. The primary motivation in providing support was the very last act, in which the Tina Fey character visits the home of a young Marine who had suffered the loss of both legs in combat. His character is the complete opposite of the stereotypical ""wounded warrior, ” as he and his young family are doing quite well, and sets the reporter in pursuit of a new, positive lifestyle."
