    "For some tvseries, which do not have the episode information in the US DoD document, we have used the tvseries IMDB ID instead of episode IMDB ID. Thus, the OMDB API did not return a director name as there can be multiple directors to the series. Nevertheless, some series have only director. Such information can be found at [source](https://datasets.imdbws.com/), specifically [crew_dataset](title.crew.tsv.gz) and [name_dataset](name.basics.tsv.gz).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, the directors name where there is no ambiguity is filled. We defined the ambiguous directors for the TV shows if there is more than one director ids are presented. Hence, we will only replace the directors' names where there is only one director id available."
