    "# Analysis of Plots of the movies and Remarks made by DoD\n",

    "Using [Scatter Text](https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext).\n",
    "\n",
    "To comprehend the influence of politics through DoD on the production of movies and TV shows we study the terms used in the remarks and plots of the films and TV shows. More specifically, we look at the differences in terms present in the corpus for the movies that have been provided assistance and those that were rejected. Additionally, we will separate movies using the keywords that represent the major events like the world war, Vietnam, Iraq, Korean wars, and 9/11 (September 11) that have political prominence for the U.S. military. On this corpus subset, we shall look at the similar differences in the vocabulary.\n",

    "## About Scattertext plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an interactive HTML plot that helps in finding distinguishing terms in corpora. The x- and y- axes are the dense ranks of the term usage by categories mentioned on the axes. Each dot corresponds to a word or phrase mentioned in the remarks or plots of the selected movies. The closer a dot is to the top of the plot, the more frequently it appeared in the remarks to the category mentioned on the y axis and the further right a dot, the more that word or phrase appeared in the remarks to the category mentioned on the x-axis. Words frequently appeared in both categories."

    "The top words in the approved category - _approve_ and _approved filming_ are trivial the other words convey some important information. The word \"at\" is one of the most frequent term, indicating that the films were approved for shooting at some location and _one_ and _day_ tells us that most of the film shooting happened for a short duration of one day. The last key observation is the word _positive_. It indicates that the DoD felt the movie provides a positive image of them and thus approved. Similarly, _deny_, _decline_ and contradiction words appear highly in remarks of denied movies, trivially indicating that they were denied. However, the key terms are _negative_ and _benifit_ and indicating that those films were rejected because the DoD felt that movies portrayed a negative image of them and it did not benefit the DoD. The last key observation is _inaccurate_ showing that another reason for DoD to deny the support is an inaccurate portrayal. Looking at the characteristic words reveal that the crucial terms that separate the two categories are portrayal and depiction. Examining the remaining terms show us that some words such as _mugu, mcas, hueneme, miramar, hangar, pendleton, usmc_ exclusively appear only in the remarks of the approved movies and these are the support provided to the approved movies in terms of locations mostly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the overall plot, apart from the words mentioned above we see that _vietnam_ is inclined to the denied side on the top right. Upon looking at the occurrence of the word _vietnam_ in the corpus, we find that those movies that have celebrated the US military, South Vietnam or the war, in general, have been supported and at the same time those that had anti-war sentiments were denied. On the other side, we see that all films that deal with the korean war (bottom left) were approved. Although the USA did not win (or lose) the Korean war, the sentiment is not against the war unlike the case of Vietnam. We also observe that in the bottom left there are the terms _f_, _f/_, _c/_, and _hawk_ (the fighter jets of the US Air Force) which refer to the support type requested/provided by the DoD to the films. Then, we see that _world war_ is very frequent in approved films. This shows that again many of the films that were supported by DoD were based on historical/significant events to the US military. \n",
    "\n",
    "The word _change_ appeared in 0.4% and 2.1% in the remarks of the approved and denied films respectively. This word and the corpus associated with these two categories provide us with two important arguments. One the DoD has asked the filmmakers to make the changes and two, they have provided support to those films that have agreed to make the suggested changes to make the script favourable to them. Next, we see the term recruiting in between average and frequent near the denied terms. Looking at the corpora indicates that DoD denied the films which they deemed did not help in recruiting and at the same time it approved films that they deemed would help in recruiting.  \n",

We see that movies based on historical events where the US military either won or has not created strong anti-war sentiments in the US are present in the approved category (_world war ii, korean (war), pearl (harbor), german and japanese_) and conversely those movies that are based on situations that were not favourable to the US like _vietnam_, _anti_ are present in the denied category. When we look at the characteristic terms we find that the crucial factors that are differentiating between these categories are _portrayal, depiction and script_.
