    "Using [Scatter Text](https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext).\n",

    "To comprehend the influence of politics through DoD on the production of movies and TV shows we study the terms used in the remarks and plots of the films and TV shows. More specifically, we look at the differences in terms present in the corpus for the movies that have been provided assistance and those that were rejected. Additionally, we will separate movies using the keywords that represent the major events like the world war, Vietnam, Iraq, Korean wars, and 9/11 (September 11) that have political prominence for the U.S. military. On this corpus subset, we shall look at the similar differences in the vocabulary."
