Tom Highway is a well-decorated career military man in the United States Marine Corps, he who has seen action in Korea and Vietnam. His current rank is Gunnery Sergeant. His experiences have led him to become an opinionated, no nonsense man, who is prone to bursts of violence, especially when he's drunk, if the situation does not suit him, regardless of the specifics or people involved. Because of these actions, he has spent his fair share of overnighters behind bars. Close to retirement, one of his last assignments, one he requested, is back at his old unit at Cherry Point, North Carolina, from where he was transferred for insubordination. He is to train a reconnaissance platoon. His superior officer, the much younger and combat inexperienced Major Malcolm Powers, sees Highway as a relic of an old styled military. Highway's commanding officer, Lieutenant Ring, the platoon leader, is also a younger man who has no combat experience, but is academically inclined and happy-go-lucky. Highway finds that his team is a rag-tag bunch of slackers, who includes wannabe rock musician Stitch Jones, with who Highway had an inauspicious earlier meeting. The men in the platoon, who truly believe Highway is crazy, hate him, and don't understand why they have to follow his harsh training regimen when the United States is not currently at war. The major, who is all about efficiency regardless of combat readiness, has the same views of Highway. He is clear that he sees Highway's platoon solely as a training mechanism for his own elite squad trained by Highway's nemesis, Staff Sergeant Webster. Things for Highway and his platoon change when the United States enters into war in Grenada. Through it all, Highway tries to reconnect with his bar waitress ex-wife Aggie, he even clandestinely reading women's magazines to understand her better. Two primary obstacles stand in his way: Roy Jennings, Aggie's boss and current suitor who hates Marines, and Aggie's own remembrance of how dysfunctional their marriage was.",Nominated for 1 Oscar.

During the arrest, they are forced to kill Ghazzi. Ghazzi's brother, Terek Murad, also a mobster, begins his own form of deadly retribution against the MVD for Ghazzi's death. But the FBI and MVD also get wind that Terek has hired an assassin by the code name Jackal to carry out a hit on a high profile but unknown American target for the Americans sticking their nose in Russian affairs. Intelligence points to that target being Donald Brown, the Director of the FBI. The Jackal is known only by name and reputation but no one in authority knows who he is, what he looks like or if he even really exists. They learn of only one person alive who they know has had ties to the Jackal: former Basque separatist Isabella Zanconia, whose whereabouts are unknown. As such, the FBI and MVD decide to turn to the one person they know who has had ties to Isabella: Declan Mulqueen, who is currently in an American prison serving twenty-five years for his deadly IRA activities. To their surprise, Declan purports to have met the Jackal. Although they are unable to meet all his demands including not being able to guarantee his release and return back to Ireland after all is said and done, Declan agrees to help them on the promise that they will do their best to meet that request. What happens is largely a function of Declan's relationship with his two handlers, the MVD's Major Valentina Koslova and FBI Deputy Director Carter Preston, the latter in particular who does not fully trust Declan. It is also affected by the nature of the history between Declan, Isabella and the Jackal.

The virus wipes out Motaba River Valley, and a devastatingly huge fire bomb is dropped onto Motaba River Valley in order to reduce the chances of further infection. The bomb was dropped on the orders of corrupt General Donald McClintock, even though an army surgeon, General Bill Ford, was against the idea. 27 years later, in 1994, there is another outbreak in Motaba River Valley. At the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), located at Fort Detrick in Maryland, Colonel Sam Daniels is doing research on the Motaba virus, and so is his ex-wife Roberta Keough, who works at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. A monkey carrying the Motaba virus stows away on a ship that is heading for the USA, and after the monkey's arrival, people in Cedar Creek, California start becoming infected by the virus. Sam and Roberta head into Cedar Creek with fellow doctor Casey Schuler, and they start searching for the monkey, thinking that the monkey is the key to finding a cure. Along the way, Sam stumbles onto some information that may be of help -- McClintock has been concealing vital information from the president of the United States. Since 1967, McClintock and Ford have been in possession of E-1101, a serum that was made to cure the virus. McClintock has been trying to stop Ford from coming forward with this information, and so far, McClintock has succeeded. McClintock now wants to drop onto Cedar Creek the kind of firebomb that was dropped on Motaba River Valley 27 years ago. Sam and Roberta figure out that the virus in the Cedar Creek outbreak is a new strain of the Motaba virus -- an airborne strain that is even more contagious than the flu. When a new serum is made to stop the new strain, Sam and Roberta set out to stop McClintock from having the town blown up.",5 wins & 5 nominations.,6.6,10 Mar 1995,nm0000583

During boot camp at Camp Pendleton in San Diego, Ira strikes up a strong and long-lasting friendship with fellow marine, Jim Sorenson. Shipped to the Pacific Theatre of Operations, the two marines fight on Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima. They are among the six marines who raise the U.S. flag on Suribachi. Soon afterwards, Sorenson is killed by enemy fire in front of a stunned Ira. Later on, the surviving three marines who helped raise the flag at Iwo Jima are ordered back to the USA to participate in a war bond drive. They tour the country, surrounded by the mass-media and the adoring crowds. They participate at rallies, meetings, media-events and parades. They are asked to make public speeches to persuade the citizens to buy war bonds. However, heartbroken over his friend's death, Ira often turns to booze to give himself the courage to continue. His drinking worsens and he is sent back to his unit at the front lines. After the war his fame and notoriety makes it impossible to lead a normal life of anonymity. Many people, organizations, charities, causes and events ask for his participation, as a War Hero, for publicity purposes. But Ira, who still grieves his friend's death and doesn't consider himself a hero, is tired of all the publicity, the attention, the demanding fans and the numerous favors he's being asked for. He also feels guilty of having survived the war while his friends died. He drinks until he hits rock bottom. Vowing to stay sober, he returns to his tribe in Arizona where he lives with his family. He gives up booze and runs for election to the tribal council. Devastated by the loss in elections, Ira gets drunk one last time. He climbs the nearby mountain which, in his mind, is his personal Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima. At the top, he finally takes his rightful place among his fallen comrades.",1 nomination.,7.2,01 Dec 1961,nm0542720

Together with over 500 other passengers Margot and Pierre Bergeron, a married couple from France, the Serafinis, an Italian family, Anne Higgins, an Englishwoman, Gitta and Helmut Holzer from Germany and an American couple called Marilyn and Leon Klinghoffer board the 'Achille Lauro'. The mood is cheerful and relaxed, everyone is looking forward to twelve days of sun, sea and peace. No one suspects that there are four Palestinian terrorists among the passengers: Al Assadi, Fatayer, Al Ashker and Molqi, their leader. The ship puts to sea in perfect weather. Three marvellous days follow. Everyone appears to be happy and contented. But in the case of some of the passengers appearances are deceiving. Marilyn Klinghoffer, for example, only pretends to her crippled husband that she is well and happy; in reality she is seriously ill with cancer and knows that this will be her last voyage. She does not want to upset her husband, however. A crisis is brewing between the Bergerons: Pierre is a cold-hearted cynic who finds fault with everything and everybody, particularly his wife. Divorce is in the air. Only Gitta and Helmut Holzer, the two young Germans, who have won the trip in a competition, are really enjoying themselves; it is their first voyage and they are as happy as larks. Gitta is in an advanced stage of pregnancy. While the passengers are enjoying themselves on board, the four terrorists have locked themselves into their cabin. Only Molqi knows of the plan to seize the ship, the other three believe they are on their way to take part in a suicide mission in Israel. On 7th October about l00 passengers leave the ship in Port Said to take part in an expedition to the pyramids. Among them is Margot Bergeron, who has left her husband on board in a rage, and Luciano and Carla Serafini, who have left their two children on board in the care of their grandmother. The Klinghoffers and the Holzers have changed their minds and decided to stay on board after all. Meanwhile Molqi has received his last orders concerning the seizure of the ship by means of a telephone message from Khaled, who, as it later turns out, is in reality Abu Abbas, the Palestinian leader and confidant of Arafat. In the cabin Molqi makes his three friends believe the cabin steward has discovered their weapons. He pretends that they can therefore not continue their voyage to Israel but must seize the ship. The three are horrified - this was not what they had planned - but finally they allow Molqi to convince them that they have no alternative. The kidnapping begins. With a volley of shots the terrorists storm the bridge and the restaurant where all the passengers have assembled for lunch. All, that is, except Anne Higgins, the Englishwoman, who spends the days of the kidnapping hidden in the bathroom of her cabin. The passengers are filled with fear and horror, only Leon Klinghoffer, the cripple, does not allow himself to be intimidated and comments on the nightmarish situation with black humour. Meanwhile, the ship' s captain transmits radio messages to inform the world about the seizure of his ship and the pirates' demands. Fifty Palestinians must be freed from Israeli prisons before the terrorists are prepared to surrender the ship. There is hectic activity in Rome, Washington, Cairo, Tel Aviv, Bonn, London and Paris. Aeroplanes are deployed over the Mediterranean to search for the vanished ship, the ambassadors of the countries involved meet in Cairo, radio messages with orders are transmitted back and forth. While the ship is approaching the Syrian coast, American, Israeli and British passengers are separated from the others. Fear continues to grow. When finally the Syrian port of Tartous appears on the horizon, the end of the kidnapping seems to be in sight. The terrorists assure the passengers that everything will soon be over. Hopes for a happy end grow stronger. But suddenly Molqi appears. He forces the American, Israeli and British hostages to leave the hall and go onto the top deck of the ship. The passengers from the USA, Israel and England are huddled together on the top deck, the sides of which slope down without a railing. One false move and they will land in the water... Only Leon Klinghoffer remains on a lower deck, alone in his wheelchair. The terrorists do not suspect that the radio messages Molqi has been exchanging with the Syrian government have been overheard from a plane: the Syrian government will not let the terrorists land and refuses to conduct negotiations on their behalf. The plan seems to have failed. Molqi threatens to kill one of the passengers if his conditions are not fulfilled. Shortly after this Molqi approaches Leon Klinghoffer by himself. He pushes the American round the deck in his wheelchair - and finally kills him. The other terrorists are horrified at the murder. When the hostages are allowed to leave the top deck Klinghoffer's wife goes to look for her husband, but she is told that although he is in the ship' s hospital and well, she is not allowed to see him. The ship sets course for Libya, but here, too, she is sent away again. All the Arab countries have meanwhile dissociated themselves from the kidnapping, the pirates are alone with their terrible crime. Even Arafat, the leader of the Palestinians, wants nothing to do with the kidnappers. He does, however, send his second-in-command to Cairo to negotiate with the terrorists and persuade them to surrender peacefully. This second-in-command is Abu Abbas, the man with whom Molqi is in constant radio contact. Meanwhile it is rumoured among the passengers that Leon Klinghoffer has been murdered. But Molqi still compells the ship's captain to deny that Klinghoffer is dead. Even Abu Abbas, who has ordered Molqi to return to Port Said and is now the official mediator, is told by the captain (acting on Molqi's orders ) that no lives have been lost on the ship. For only if all the passengers remain unharmed are the ambassadors of the countries involved prepared to comply with Abbas's demand that the terrorists be surrendered to the Palestinians, who will then bring charges against them themselves. Besides this, the ambassadors must agree not to extradite the terrorists to any of the countries concerned. Molqi and the other terrorists meanwhile realize that the seizure of the ship has failed and that there is no chance that they will be able to force the Israelis to let the imprisoned Palestinians go free. When Abu Abbas orders them to apologize to the passengers, they obey him. The passengers, too, have now heard that the kidnapping is over. They are relieved and happy, and so far no one knows for sure that Leon Klinghoffer is dead. When a ship belonging to the Egyptian Secret Service comes to pick up the terrorists, they leave the 'Achille Lauro'. The nightmare is over. Only now does Marilyn Klinghoffer learn that her husband has been murdered. In spite of the agreement stipulating that the pirates are not to be extradited, the American ambassador, feeling that he has been misled by Abu Abbas, promises Mrs. Klinghoffer to do everything in his power to have the terrorists tried by an American court. While the passengers are recovering from the strain they have gone through and are being taken home, the American Secret Service listens in on a radio message saying when the pirates are to be flown out of Egypt. A plan is concocted. On 12th Octoberr the Boeing with the pirates and Abu Abbas on board is forced by two American military machines to land on the NATO base in Sicily. In spite of the Americans ' demand that the kidnappers be handed over to them, they are - after lengthy political disputes - surrendered to the Italian authorities, where they are identified by Marilyn Klinghoffer. Abu Abbas remains at large. The kidnappers are tried in Italy and sentenced to between l5 and 30 years imprisonment.",,6.1,29 Apr 1990,nm0624477

Clarice is able to figure out the assignment is to pick Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as Buffalo Bill who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern US, all young women who are slightly overweight especially around the hips, all who were drowned in natural bodies of water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her as a woman to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game with her having often to read between the very cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along as his request in return for talking to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes more dire turns when a sixth victim is discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence if Lecter is being forthright as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin, the daughter of Senator Ruth Martin, which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully still alive Catherine. Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton, the warden at the prison, he an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, meaning a higher profile for himself if he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.",Won 5 Oscars.

Almost immediately after Tonya is found and rushed to a hospital, Pete and Billy Ray are found at a roadside bar, where they had been bragging about what they did to Tonya. Tonya's understandably distraught and enraged father, Carl Lee Hailey, remembers a case from a year ago, when four white men raped an African-American girl in a nearby town, and got acquitted. Carl is determined to not let that happen in this case. While deputy Dwayne Powell Looney is escorting Pete and Billy Ray up a flight of stairs to a court room, Carl emerges from the building's basement with an assault rifle, and he kills Pete and Billy Ray for what they did to Tonya. Carl is later arrested at his house by African-American sheriff Ozzie Walls, and Carl is scheduled to be placed on trial. Despite the efforts of the NAACP and local African-American leaders to persuade Carl to choose some of their high-powered attorneys, Carl wants to be represented by his friend Jake Tyler Brigance, who has a wife named Carla and a daughter named Hannah. Presiding over the trial is white judge Omar Noose, and the prosecution attorney is Rufus Buckley, who would like nothing more than to win the case and swim in the publicity that a win would generate, because Rufus realizes that a murder conviction could help him gain higher office. Helping Jake on the case are his former law professor Lucien Wilbanks, fellow attorney Harry Rex Vonner, and law student Ellen Roark. Ellen has had experience with death penalty cases, and that's exactly what Rufus may be seeking. To start things off, Noose denies bail and denies Jake's petition for a change of venue. Carl has also been fired from his job. Billy Ray Cobb's brother Freddie Lee Cobb wants revenge on Carl, so Freddy gets the help of the Mississippi branch of the KKK, led by Mississippi grand dragon Stump Sisson. Carl's wife Gwen tells Carl that a doctor has said that because of Pete and Billy Ray, Tonya's reproductive organs are damaged enough to where she won't be able to have kids when she grows up. That night, a KKK member is found trying to plant a bomb under Jake's porch. Jake's secretary Ethel Twitty and her husband Bud are also attacked by the KKK. Still, Jake, Harry, Lucien, and Ellen continue to help Carl. On the day the trial begins, there is a riot outside the court building between the KKK and the area's African-American residents, and Stump Sisson is killed by a molotov cocktail that was dropped from a roof by one of Carl's sons, who was not seen dropping it. Freddy and the KKK start burning crosses throughout Canton, and one of the crosses burns Jake's house down while Jake and his family are not home. As a result, the National Guard is called to Canton to keep the peace during the trial. But Freddy is not about to let that stop him. While Freddy continues his efforts to get revenge on Carl for Billy Ray's death, Carl's attorneys put everything they've got into Carl's defense.",Nominated for 1 Golden Globe.

His body is later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky, but before going into a comatose state Megatron uses the last of his energy to engrave into the Captain's glasses a map showing the location of the Allspark, and to send a transmission to Cybertron. Megatron is then carried away aboard the Captain's ship. A century later, Captain Witwicky's grandson Sam Witwicky (nicknamed Spike by his friends) buys his first car. To his shock, he discovers it to be Bumblebee, an Autobot in disguise who is to protect Spike, who possesses the Captain's glasses and the map engraved on them. But Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have arrived on Earth - in the desert of Qatar, the Decepticons Blackout and Scorponok attack a U.S. military base, causing the Pentagon to send their special Sector Seven agents to capture all ""specimens of this alien race."" Spike and his girlfriend Mikaela find themselves in the midst of a grand battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, stretching from Hoover Dam all the way to Los Angeles.
